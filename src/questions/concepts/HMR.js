/* 
In React (especially with Vite or Webpack), Hot Module Replacement (HMR) allows you to update modules in real-time without reloading the entire page. 
This means your state is preserved, making development smoother.

ðŸ”¥ How HMR Works in React
When you save a file, HMR only updates the changed modules.
Your app state is preserved (unless the updated module changes state logic).
No need to refresh the browser manually.
